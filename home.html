            DLK International School is one of the oldest,best day & residential schools in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. We are a co-educational
            institution from the kindergarten to class XII. The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education
            (CBSE), New Delhi and the students appear in the All India Secondary and Senior School Certificate Examinations
            of 10+2 pattern conducted by the Board. Founded in 1952, DLK International School has a long standing in the
            field of education. The School caters to the educational, cultural and recreational needs of more than 3000 children
            from far and near. The facilities provided by our School in Dehradun are comparable to the best of schools in
            the country. Through this page we pay homage to Late Smt Kiran Khanna and Mr S L Khanna, founders of this prestigious
            institution whom we fondly called “Badi Mam” and “Bade Sir” A young couple from pre independance Lahore, Smt
            Kiran Khanna and Sri S L Khanna travelled to Doon valley with a dream in their hearts.A couple who was humanitarian,
            altruistic & compassionate worked in the field of education. With patience & far sight they saw their dream blossoming
            in the shape of Vidya Mandir. Children who crossed the threshold of DLK International School were dear to their
            heart. The humble beginings with a mere handful of 5 children led to colossal heights as we see DLK International
            School today with thousands of children not only from Dehradun but from all over the world. DLK International
            School is now one of the premier institutions of the educational hub of Uttarakhand. They lived, worked and dedicated
            their life to a cause far bigger than life itself. We feel their presence more intensely than ever before. DLK
            International School pledges to uphold the values and ideas set down by the founders. The best homage we can
            pay to our founders is to live up to their expectations and thereby keep them ever alive in our hearts, minds
            and spirits. We pledge to always follow the path set by our founders.
